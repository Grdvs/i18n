デジタルデータが搾取される現代において、あなたのプライバシーはかつてないほど重要になっています。しかし、多くの人はプライバシーが既に失われていると感じています。 それは違います。 ==プライバシーは手に入ります==が、あなたはそれを気にかける必要があります。 プライバシーは力であり、この力が正しい人の手にあることは非常に重要です。

プライバシーは究極的には人間の情報に関するものであり、人間の情報は人間に力を与えるので、これは重要です。 真に満たされた自由な人間になる能力が欲しいなら、私たちの情報に適用されるルールをよく確認する必要があります。 現代社会の多くは**情報**を中心に構成されています。 オンラインで買い物をするとき、ニュースを読むとき、何かを調べるとき、投票するとき、道順を調べたるとき、その他あらゆることをするときにあなたは情報に頼っています。 情報社会において、私たちの情報は重要であり、したがってプライバシーは重要です。

## プライバシーとは何か？

多くの人は、**プライバシー**、**セキュリティ**、**匿名性**の概念を混同しています。 You'll see people criticize various products as "not private" when really they mean it doesn't provide anonymity, for example. On this website, we cover all three of these topics, but it is important you understand the difference between them, and when each one comes into play.

**プライバシー**
:

==Privacy is the assurance that your data is only seen by the parties you intend to view it.== In the context of an instant messenger, for example, end-to-end encryption provides privacy by keeping your message visible only to yourself and the recipient.

**セキュリティ**
:

Security is the ability to trust the applications you use—that the parties involved are who they say they are—and keep those applications safe. In the context of browsing the web, for example, security can be provided by HTTPS certificates.
:

Certificates prove you are talking directly to the website you're visiting, and keep attackers on your network from reading or modifying the data sent to or from the website.

**匿名性**
:

Anonymity is the ability to act without a persistent identifier. You might achieve this online with [Tor](../tor.md), which allows you to browse the internet with a random IP address and network connection instead of your own.
:

**Pseudonymity** is a similar concept, but it allows you to have a persistent identifier without it being tied to your real identity. If everybody knows you as `@GamerGuy12` online, but nobody knows your real name, that is your pseudonym.

All of these concepts overlap, but it is possible to have any combination of these. The sweet spot for most people is when all three of these concepts overlap. However, it's trickier to achieve than many initially believe. Sometimes, you have to compromise on some of these, and that's okay too. This is where **threat modeling** comes into play, allowing you to make informed decisions about the [software and services](../tools.md) you use.

## Privacy vs. Secrecy

A common counter-argument to pro-privacy movements is the notion that one doesn't need privacy if they have **"nothing to hide."** This is a dangerous misconception, because it creates a sense that people who demand privacy must be deviant, criminal, or wrong.

==You shouldn't confuse privacy with secrecy.== We know what happens in the bathroom, but you still close the door. 用を足しているという事実を秘密にするためではなく、プライバシーを守るためにドアを閉めるのです。 There are always certain facts about us—say, personal health information, or sexual behavior—that we wouldn't want the whole world to know, and that's okay. The need for privacy is legitimate, and that's what makes us human. Privacy is about empowering your rights over your own information, not about hiding secrets.

## Is Privacy About Control?

A common definition of privacy is that it is the ability to *control* who has access to your data. This is an easy trap to fall into, in fact it is the definition of privacy we operated this website on for a long time. It sounds nice, and it appeals to many people, but in practice it just doesn't work.

Take cookie consent forms, for example. You may encounter these dozens of times per day on the various websites you visit, with a nice array of checkboxes and sliders which allow you to "curate" your preferences to exactly fit your needs. In the end, we just hit the "I Agree" button, because we just want to read the article or make a purchase. Nobody wants to complete a personal privacy audit on every single website they visit. This is an exercise in [choice architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture), designed to make you take the easy route out instead of delving into a maze of configuration options that don't need to exist in the first place.

==Control over your privacy inside most apps is an illusion.== It's a shiny dashboard with all sorts of choices you can make about your data, but rarely the choices you're looking for, like "only use my data to help me." This type of control is meant to make you feel guilty about your choices, that you "had the choice" to make the apps you use more private, and you chose not to.

Privacy is something we need to have baked into the [software and services](../tools.md) we use by default, you can't bend most apps into being private on your own.
