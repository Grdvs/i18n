セキュリティ、プライバシー、使いやすさのバランスを取ることは、プライバシー保護を考える際に最初に直面する難しい課題の一つです。 一般的に、安全性を高めるほど制限が増え、不便になるというトレードオフが発生します。 多くの場合、おすすめされたツールの問題は、使い始めるのが難しすぎることです。

**最も**安全なツールを使うには、*多くの*使いやすさを犠牲にする必要があります。 そして、それでも、==完全に安全にはなりません。==**高レベル**のセキュリティはあっても、**完全な**セキュリティはありません。 だからこそ、脅威モデルが重要なのです。

**脅威モデルとは何ですか？**

==脅威モデルとは、あなたのセキュリティとプライバシーにとって脅威になる可能性の高いものの一覧です。==**すべての**攻撃から身を守るのは不可能なので、**可能性の高い**脅威への対策に重点を置く必要があります。 情報セキュリティにおいて、脅威とは、プライベートで安全な状態を維持するというあなたの努力を損なう可能性のある事象のことです。

あなたにとって重大な脅威に焦点を当てることで、必要な保護を絞り込み、必要なツールを選ぶことができます。

## 脅威モデルの作成

あなたの大切なものに何が起こる可能性があるかを特定し、誰から守るべきかを判断するために、以下の5つの質問を確認しましょう:

1. 何を守りたいか？
2. 誰から守りたいか？
3. 守る必要がどの程度あるか？
4. 守れなかった場合、どんな悪影響があるか？
5. 守るためにどの程度なら苦労していいか？

### 何を守りたいか？

「資産」とは、あなたが大切にしているもの、守りたいものです。 情報セキュリティにおいては、==資産とは通常、何らかの情報です。==例えば、メール、連絡帳、インスタントメッセージ、位置情報、ファイルなどはすべて資産です。 また、デバイスが資産に含まれる場合もあります。

*あなたの資産の一覧を作成しましょう。一覧には、あなたが保管しているデータ、その保管場所、それにアクセスできる人、他人によるアクセスを防止する方法を記載します。*

### 誰から守りたいか？

To answer this question, it's important to identify who might want to target you or your information. ==A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “adversary”.== Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.

*Make a list of your adversaries or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.*

Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances, this list might be something you want to destroy after you're done security planning.

### 守る必要がどの程度あるか？

==Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur.== It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.

It is important to distinguish between what might happen and the probability it may happen. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).

Assessing risks is both a personal and subjective process. Many people find certain threats unacceptable, no matter the likelihood they will occur, because the mere presence of the threat is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.

*Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.*

### 守れなかった場合、どんな悪影響があるか？

There are many ways that an adversary could gain access to your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.

==The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their tactics.== A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.

Security planning involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully gains access to one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the capability of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all of your phone records. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.

*Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.*

### 守るためにどの程度なら苦労していいか？

==There is no perfect option for security.== Not everyone has the same priorities, concerns, or access to resources. Your risk assessment will allow you to plan the right strategy for you, balancing convenience, cost, and privacy.

For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case may be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.

*Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.*

### Try it yourself: Protecting Your Belongings

These questions can apply to a wide variety of situations, online and offline. As a generic demonstration of how these questions work, let's build a plan to keep your house and possessions safe.

**What do you want to protect? (Or, *what do you have that is worth protecting?*)**
:

Your assets might include jewelry, electronics, important documents, or photos.

**Who do you want to protect it from?**
:

Your adversaries might include burglars, roommates, or guests.

**How likely is it that you will need to protect it?**
:

Does your neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are your roommates or guests? What are the capabilities of your adversaries? What are the risks you should consider?

**How bad are the consequences if you fail?**
:

Do you have anything in your house that you cannot replace? Do you have the time or money to replace those things? Do you have insurance that covers goods stolen from your home?

**How much trouble are you willing to go through to prevent these consequences?**
:

Are you willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can you afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do you have time to open a security box at your local bank and keep your valuables there?

Only once you have asked yourself these questions will you be in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the probability of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the probability of a break-in is high, you'll want to get the best lock on the market and consider adding a security system.

Making a security plan will help you to understand the threats that are unique to you and to evaluate your assets, your adversaries, and your adversaries' capabilities, along with the likelihood of risks you face.
