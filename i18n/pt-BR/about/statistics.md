title: Traffic Statistics

Nós hospedamos o [Umami] (https\://umami.is) para criar uma boa visualização de nossas estatísticas de tráfego, que são públicas no link abaixo. With this process:

- Your information is never shared with a third-party, it stays on servers we control
- Your personal data is never saved, we only collect data in aggregate
- No client-side JavaScript is required

Because of these facts, keep in mind our statistics may be inaccurate. It is a useful tool to compare different dates with each other and analyze overall trends, but the actual numbers may be far off from reality. They're _precise_ statistics, but not _accurate_ statistics.
