# 社區行為守則

**我們承諾** 打造一個沒有人受騷擾的社區。

**我們致力於**打造正向環境、 使用歡迎包容語言、尊重接納別人的觀點。

**我們不允許**不適當的行為，例如性用語、捉弄與侮辱評論、鼓吹對立或騷擾。

## 社區標準

我們對社區成員的期許:

1. **Do not spread misinformation**

      We are creating an evidence-based educational community around information privacy and security, not an information home for conspiracy theories. For example, when making a claim that a certain piece of software is malicious or that certain telemetry data is privacy invasive, explain in detail what is collected and how it collected. 宣稱的本質必須有技術證據支撐。

2. **Do not abuse our willingness to help**

      Our community members are not free tech support. We are happy to help with specific steps for your privacy journey, if you are willing to put in effort. We are not obligated to answer endless, repetitive questions about general computer problems solvable with a simple internet search. **Do not** become a [help vampire](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires).

3. **舉止要積極正向**

      有助於為社區創造積極環境的行為示例包括：

      - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
      - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
      - Focusing on what is best not just for us as overseers, but for the overall community.
      - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback within our community while growing and improving.
      - Operating with a communal mindset at all times.

## Scope

我們的行為守則適用在專案的各個面向，也適用於在外代表 Privacy Guides 的個人。
