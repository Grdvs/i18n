**Tor** 网络是一组由志愿者操作的服务器，允许您免费连接以提高您的互联网的隐私和安全。 个人和组织也可以通过Tor网络与".onion隐藏服务"分享信息，而不损害其隐私。 由于Tor流量难以阻止和跟踪，因此Tor是一种有效的审查规避工具。

[:octicons-heart-16:](https://donate.torproject.org/){ .card-link title=Contribute }

Tor的工作原理是通过这些志愿者操作的服务器路由您的互联网流量，而不是直接连接到您试图访问的网站。 这会混淆流量的来源，并且连接路径中的任何服务器都无法看到流量来自和流向的完整路径，这意味着即使您用于连接的服务器也无法打破您的匿名性。

## 连接到Tor

<div class="admonition tip" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>

Before connecting to Tor, please ensure you've read our [overview](advanced/tor-overview.md) on what Tor is and how to connect to it safely. We often recommend connecting to Tor through a trusted [VPN provider](vpn.md), but you have to do so **properly** to avoid decreasing your anonymity.

</div>

有多种方法可以从您的设备连接到Tor网络，最常用的是 **Tor浏览器**，这是Firefox的一个分支，专为桌面计算机和Android的匿名浏览而设计。

Some of these apps are better than others, and again making a determination comes down to your threat model. If you are a casual Tor user who is not worried about your ISP collecting evidence against you, using apps like [Orbot](#orbot) or mobile browser apps to access the Tor network is probably fine. Increasing the number of people who use Tor on an everyday basis helps reduce the bad stigma of Tor, and lowers the quality of "lists of Tor users" that ISPs and governments may compile.

If more complete anonymity is paramount to your situation, you should **only** be using the desktop Tor Browser client, ideally in a [Whonix](desktop.md#whonix) + [Qubes](desktop.md#qubes-os) configuration. Mobile browsers are less common on Tor (and more fingerprintable as a result), and other configurations are not as rigorously tested against deanonymization.

### Tor浏览器

<div class="admonition danger" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>

You should **never** install any additional extensions on Tor Browser or edit `about:config` settings, including the ones we suggest for Firefox. Browser extensions and non-standard settings make you stand out from others on the Tor network, thus making your browser easier to [fingerprint](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/browser-fingerprinting).

</div>

Tor浏览器旨在防止指纹识别，或根据您的浏览器配置识别您。 Therefore, it is imperative that you do **not** modify the browser beyond the default [security levels](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/).

In addition to installing Tor Browser on your computer directly, there are also operating systems designed specifically to connect to the Tor network such as [Whonix](desktop.md#whonix) on [Qubes OS](desktop.md#qubes-os), which provide even greater security and protections than the standard Tor Browser alone.

### Orbot

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Orbot logo](assets/img/self-contained-networks/orbot.svg){ align=right }

**Orbot** is a free Tor VPN for smartphones which routes traffic from any app on your device through the Tor network.

</div>

We previously recommended enabling the *Isolate Destination Address* preference in Orbot settings. While this setting can theoretically improve privacy by enforcing the use of a different circuit for each IP address you connect to, it doesn't provide a practical advantage for most applications (especially web browsing), can come with a significant performance penalty, and increases the load on the Tor network. We no longer recommend adjusting this setting from its default value unless you know you need to.[^1]

<div class="admonition tip" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Tips for Android</p>

Orbot can proxy individual apps if they support SOCKS or HTTP proxying. It can also proxy all your network connections using [VpnService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService) and can be used with the VPN killswitch in :gear: **Settings** → **Network & internet** → **VPN** → :gear: → **Block connections without VPN**.

Orbot is often outdated on the Guardian Project's [F-Droid repository](https://guardianproject.info/fdroid) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android), so consider downloading directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases) instead.

All versions are signed using the same signature so they should be compatible with each other.

### Onion Browser

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Onion Browser logo](assets/img/self-contained-networks/onion_browser.svg){ align=right }

**Onion Browser** is an open-source browser that lets you browse the web anonymously over the Tor network on iOS devices and is endorsed by the [Tor Project](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/onion-browser/).

## Relays and Bridges

### Snowflake

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Snowflake logo](assets/img/browsers/snowflake.svg#only-light){ align=right }
![Snowflake logo](assets/img/browsers/snowflake-dark.svg#only-dark){ align=right }

**Snowflake** allows you to donate bandwidth to the Tor Project by operating a "Snowflake proxy" within your browser.

People who are censored can use Snowflake proxies to connect to the Tor network. Snowflake is a great way to contribute to the network even if you don't have the technical know-how to run a Tor relay or bridge.

[:octicons-home-16: Homepage](https://snowflake.torproject.org/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[:octicons-info-16:](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/Technical%20Overview){ .card-link title=Documentation}

[:octicons-heart-16:](https://donate.torproject.org/){ .card-link title=Contribute }

</details>

</div>

You can enable Snowflake in your browser by opening it in another tab and turning the switch on. You can leave it running in the background while you browse to contribute your connection. We don't recommend installing Snowflake as a browser extension; adding third-party extensions can increase your attack surface.

[Run Snowflake in your Browser :material-arrow-right-drop-circle:](https://snowflake.torproject.org/embed.html ""){.md-button}

Snowflake does not increase your privacy in any way, nor is it used to connect to the Tor network within your personal browser. However, if your internet connection is uncensored, you should consider running it to help people in censored networks achieve better privacy themselves. There is no need to worry about which websites people are accessing through your proxy—their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours.

Running a Snowflake proxy is low-risk, even moreso than running a Tor relay or bridge which are already not particularly risky endeavours. However, it does still proxy traffic through your network which can be impactful in some ways, especially if your network is bandwidth-limited. Make sure you understand [how Snowflake works](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/home) before deciding whether to run a proxy.

[^1]: The `IsolateDestAddr` setting is discussed on the [Tor mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-May/024403.html) and [Whonix's Stream Isolation documentation](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation), where both projects suggest that it is usually not a good approach for most people.
