> To find [privacy-focused alternative] apps, check out sites like Good Reports and **Privacy Guides**, which list privacy-focused apps in a variety of categories, notably including email providers (usually on paid plans) that aren’t run by the big tech companies.

> If you're looking for a new VPN, you can go to the discount code of just about any podcast. If you are looking for a **good** VPN, you need professional help. The same goes for email clients, browsers, operating systems and password managers. How do you know which of these is the best, most privacy-friendly option? For that there is **Privacy Guides**, a platform on which a number of volunteers search day in, day out for the best privacy-friendly tools to use on the internet.

## History

Privacy Guides was launched in September 2021 as a continuation of the [defunct](privacytools.md) "PrivacyTools" open-source educational project. We recognized the importance of independent, criteria-focused product recommendations and general knowledge in the privacy space, which is why we needed to preserve the work that had been created by so many contributors since 2015 and make sure that information had a stable home on the web indefinitely.

In 2022, we completed the transition of our main website framework from Jekyll to MkDocs, using the `mkdocs-material` documentation software. This change made open-source contributions to our site significantly easier for outsiders, because instead of needing to know complicated syntax to write posts effectively, contributing is now as easy as writing a standard Markdown document.

We additionally launched our new discussion forum at [discuss.privacyguides.net](https://discuss.privacyguides.net) as a community platform to share ideas and ask questions about our mission. This augments our existing community on Matrix, and replaced our previous GitHub Discussions platform, decreasing our reliance on proprietary discussion platforms.

So far in 2023 we've launched international translations of our website in [French](/fr/), [Hebrew](/he/), and [Dutch](/nl/), with more languages on the way, made possible by our excellent translation team on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides). We plan to continue carrying forward our mission of outreach and education, and finding ways to more clearly highlight the dangers of a lack of privacy awareness in the modern digital age, and the prevalence and harms of security breaches across the technology industry.
