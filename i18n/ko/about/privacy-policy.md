## 방문자로부터 수집하는 데이터

Privacy Guides에게 있어 중요한 것은 바로 여러분의 프라이버시입니다. 따라서 저희는 각각의 개인을 추적하지 않습니다. As a visitor to our website:

- No personal information is collected
- No information such as cookies are stored in the browser
- No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties
- No information is shared with advertising companies
- No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends
- No information is monetized

You can view the data we collect on our [statistics](statistics.md) page.

We run a self-hosted installation of [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected.

Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can learn more about how Plausible works and collects information in a privacy-respecting manner [here](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

## Data We Collect From Account Holders

On some websites and services we provide, many features may require an account. For example, an account may be required to post and reply to topics on a forum platform.

To sign up for most accounts, we will collect a name, username, email, and password. In the event a website requires more information than just that data, that will be clearly marked and noted in a separate privacy statement per-site.

We use your account data to identify you on the website and to create pages specific to you, such as your profile page. We will also use your account data to publish a public profile for you on our services.

We use your email to:

- Notify you about posts and other activity on the websites or services.
- Reset your password and help keep your account secure.
- Contact you in special circumstances related to your account.
- Contact you about legal requests, such as DMCA takedown requests.

On some websites and services you may provide additional information for your account, such as a short biography, avatar, your location, or your birthday. We make that information available to everyone who can access the website or service in question. This information is not required to use any of our services and can be erased at any time.

We will store your account data as long as your account remains open. After closing an account, we may retain some or all of your account data in the form of backups or archives for up to 90 days.

## Contacting Us

The Privacy Guides team generally does not have access to personal data outside of limited access granted via some moderation panels. Inquiries regarding your personal information should be sent directly to:

Jonah Aragon
Services Administrator
jonah@privacyguides.org
```

For all other inquiries, you can contact any member of our team.

For complaints under GDPR more generally, you may lodge complaints with your local data protection supervisory authorities. In France it's the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés which take care and handle the complaints. They provide a [template of complaint letter](https://www.cnil.fr/en/plaintes) to use.

## About This Policy

We will post any new versions of this statement [here](privacy-policy.md). We may change how we announce changes in future versions of this document. In the meantime we may update our contact information at any time without announcing a change. Please refer to the [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) for the latest contact information at any time.
