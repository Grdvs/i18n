Password managers allow you to securely store and manage passwords and other credentials with the use of a master password.

[Introduction to Passwords :material-arrow-right-drop-circle:](./basics/passwords-overview.md)

!!! info

    Built-in password managers in software like browsers and operating systems are sometimes not as good as dedicated password manager software. The advantage of a built-in password manager is good integration with the software, but it can often be very simple and lack privacy and security features standalone offerings have.
    
    For example, the password manager in Microsoft Edge doesn't offer E2EE at all. Google's password manager has [optional](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/11350823) E2EE, and [Apple's](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303) offers E2EE by default.

## Cloud-based

These password managers sync your passwords to a cloud server for easy accessibility from all your devices and safety against device loss.

### Bitwarden

!!! recommendation

    ![Bitwarden logo](assets/img/password-management/bitwarden.svg){ align=right }
    
    **Bitwarden** is a free and open-source password manager. It aims to solve password management problems for individuals, teams, and business organizations. Bitwarden is among the best and safest solutions to store all of your logins and passwords while conveniently keeping them synced between all of your devices.

        - [:simple-microsoftedge: Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/jbkfoedolllekgbhcbcoahefnbanhhlh)

Bitwarden also features [Bitwarden Send](https://bitwarden.com/products/send/), which allows you to share text and files securely with [end-to-end encryption](https://bitwarden.com/help/send-encryption). A [password](https://bitwarden.com/help/send-privacy/#send-passwords) can be required along with the send link. Bitwarden Send also features [automatic deletion](https://bitwarden.com/help/send-lifespan).

You need the [Premium Plan](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-bitwarden-plans/#compare-personal-plans) to be able to share files. The free plan only allows text sharing.

Bitwarden's server-side code is [open-source](https://github.com/bitwarden/server), so if you don't want to use the Bitwarden cloud, you can easily host your own Bitwarden sync server.

**Vaultwarden** is an alternative implementation of Bitwarden's sync server written in Rust and compatible with official Bitwarden clients, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal. If you are looking to self-host Bitwarden on your own server, you almost certainly want to use Vaultwarden over Bitwarden's official server code.

### 1Password

!!! recommendation

    ![1Password logo](assets/img/password-management/1password.svg){ align=right }
    
    **1Password** is a password manager with a strong focus on security and ease-of-use, which allows you to store passwords, credit cards, software licenses, and any other sensitive information in a secure digital vault. Your vault is hosted on 1Password's servers for a [monthly fee](https://1password.com/sign-up/). 1Password is [audited](https://support.1password.com/security-assessments/) on a regular basis and provides exceptional customer support. 1Password is closed source; however, the security of the product is thoroughly documented in their [security white paper](https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf).
    
    [:octicons-home-16: Homepage](https://1password.com/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    [:octicons-eye-16:](https://support.1password.com/1password-privacy/){ .card-link title="Privacy Policy" }
    [:octicons-info-16:](https://support.1password.com/){ .card-link title=Documentation}
    
    ??? downloads

        - [:simple-appstore: App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1511601750?mt=8)
        - [:simple-windows11: Windows](https://1password.com/downloads/windows/)
        - [:simple-apple: macOS](https://1password.com/downloads/mac/)
        - [:simple-linux: Linux](https://1password.com/downloads/linux/)

Traditionally, **1Password** has offered the best password manager user experience for people using macOS and iOS; however, it has now achieved feature-parity across all platforms. It boasts many features geared towards families and less technical people, as well as advanced functionality.

Your 1Password vault is secured with both your master password and a randomized 34-character security key to encrypt your data on their servers. This security key adds a layer of protection to your data because your data is secured with high entropy regardless of your master password. Many other password manager solutions are entirely reliant on the strength of your master password to secure your data.

One advantage 1Password has over Bitwarden is its first-class support for native clients. While Bitwarden relegates many duties, especially account management features, to their web vault interface, 1Password makes nearly every feature available within its native mobile or desktop clients. 1Password's clients also have a more intuitive UI, which makes them easier to use and navigate.

### Psono

!!! recommendation

    ![Psono logo](assets/img/password-management/psono.svg){ align=right }
    
    **Psono** is a free and open-source password manager from Germany, with a focus on password management for teams. Psono supports secure sharing of passwords, files, bookmarks, and emails. All secrets are protected by a master password.

Psono provides extensive documentation for their product. The web-client for Psono can be self-hosted; alternatively, you can choose the full Community Edition or the Enterprise Edition with additional features.

### 평가 기준

**Privacy Guides는 권장 목록의 어떠한 프로젝트와도 제휴를 맺지 않았습니다.** 객관적인 권장 목록을 제공하기 위해, [일반적인 평가 기준](about/criteria.md)에 더해 명확한 요구 사항을 정립하였습니다. 어떠한 프로젝트를 선택해 사용하기 전에, 이러한 요구 사항들을 숙지하고 여러분 스스로 조사하는 과정을 거쳐 적절한 선택을 하시기 바랍니다.

!!! example "이 단락은 최근에 만들어졌습니다"

    Privacy Guides 팀은 사이트의 모든 항목마다 명확한 평가 기준을 정립하는 중이며, 따라서 세부 내용은 변경될 수 있습니다. 평가 기준에 대해서 질문이 있다면 [포럼에서 문의](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest)하시기 바랍니다. (무언가가 목록에 존재하지 않다고 해서 권장 목록을 작성할 때 고려한 적이 없을 것으로 단정 짓지 마세요.) 권장 목록에 어떤 프로젝트를 추가할 때 고려하고 논의해야 할 요소는 매우 많으며, 모든 요소를 문서화하는 것은 현재 진행 중인 작업입니다.

#### Minimum Requirements

- Must utilize strong, standards-based/modern E2EE.
- Must have thoroughly documented encryption and security practices.
- Must have a published audit from a reputable, independent third-party.
- All non-essential telemetry must be optional.
- Must not collect more PII than is necessary for billing purposes.

#### Best-Case

Our best-case criteria represents what we would like to see from the perfect project in this category. Our recommendations may not include any or all of this functionality, but those which do may rank higher than others on this page.

- Telemetry should be opt-in (disabled by default) or not collected at all.
- Should be open-source and reasonably self-hostable.

## Local Storage

These options allow you to manage an encrypted password database locally.

### KeePassXC

!!! recommendation

    ![KeePassXC logo](assets/img/password-management/keepassxc.svg){ align=right }
    
    **KeePassXC** is a community fork of KeePassX, a native cross-platform port of KeePass Password Safe, with the goal to extend and improve it with new features and bugfixes to provide a feature-rich, cross-platform and modern open-source password manager.

        - [:simple-googlechrome: Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk)

KeePassXC stores its export data as [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files. This may mean data loss if you import this file into another password manager. We advise you check each record manually.

### KeePassDX (Android)

!!! recommendation

    ![KeePassDX logo](assets/img/password-management/keepassdx.svg){ align=right }
    
    **KeePassDX** is a lightweight password manager for Android, allows editing encrypted data in a single file in KeePass format and can fill in the forms in a secure way. [Contributor Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kunzisoft.keepass.pro) allows unlocking cosmetic content and non-standard protocol features, but more importantly, it helps and encourages development.

### Strongbox (iOS & macOS)

!!! recommendation

    ![Strongbox logo](assets/img/password-management/strongbox.svg){ align=right }
    
    **Strongbox** is a native, open-source password manager for iOS and macOS. Supporting both KeePass and Password Safe formats, Strongbox can be used in tandem with other password managers, like KeePassXC, on non-Apple platforms. By employing a [freemium model](https://strongboxsafe.com/pricing/), Strongbox offers most features under its free tier with more convenience-oriented [features](https://strongboxsafe.com/comparison/)—such as biometric authentication—locked behind a subscription or perpetual license.
