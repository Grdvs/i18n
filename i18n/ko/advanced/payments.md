There's a reason data about your buying habits is considered the holy grail of ad targeting: your purchases can leak a veritable treasure trove of data about you. Unfortunately, the current financial system is anti-privacy by design, enabling banks, other companies, and governments to easily trace transactions. Nevertheless, you have plenty of options when it comes to making payments privately.

## 현금

**현금**은 수 세기 동안 주된 비공개 결제 수단으로 쓰여 왔습니다. 현금은 수많은 나라들에서 사용할 뿐만 아니라, 대부분의 상황에서 매우 뛰어난 프라이버시를 제공합니다. 또한, 고유하지 않아 똑같이 생긴 물건과 구별할 수 없습니다.

현금 결제 관련 법률은 국가마다 다릅니다. 미국의 경우에는 $10,000 이상의 현금 결제를 할 때[Form 8300](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/form-8300-and-reporting-cash-payments-of-over-10000)를 이용하여 IRS에게 보고해야 합니다. 이를 받는 회사는 해당 결제를 진행하는 사람의 이름, 주소, 직업, 생년월일과 주민등록번호나 다른 TIN을 확인할 의무가 있습니다 (일부 예외 사항 제외). 환전 또는 송금과 같은 경우에는 신분증 없이 결제할 수 있는 금액이 $3,000 이하입니다. 또한, 현금에는 일렬번호가 인쇄되어 있습니다. 판매자가 일렬번호를 추적하는 일은 거의 없지만, 법 집행 기관은 수사에서 이를 사용할 수 있습니다.

그럼에도 불구하고 현금은 일반적으로 가장 좋은 결제 방식입니다.

## 선불 카드와 기프트 카드

마트나 편의점에서 현금으로 기프트 카드 또는 선불 카드를 손쉽게 구매할 수 있습니다. 기프트 카드는 대부분 수수료가 없지만, 선불 카드는 있는 경우가 많습니다. 따라서 수수료와 만료일을 잘 살펴봐야 합니다. 일부 매장은 사기를 방지하기 위해 결제 시 신분증 제시를 요청할 수 있습니다.

기프트 카드는 일반적으로 카드당 최대 $200이지만, 일부 기프트 카드는 카드당 $2,000까지 제공할 수 있습니다. Visa 또는 Mastercard 선불 카드는 일반적으로 카드당 최대 $1,000까지 제공할 수 있습니다.

기프트 카드의 단점으로는 사용할 때 사용처의 정책이 적용된다는 점입니다. 이 정책은 매우 제한적일 수 있습니다. 예시로, 몇 판매자들은 기프트 카드로만 결제하는 것을 허용하지 않거나, 고위험군 사용자라고 판단될 경우 기프트 카드를 임의로 취소할 수 있습니다. 판매자 포인트는 해당 판매자가 강력한 제어권을 지니고 있습니다.

선불 카드는 ATM을 통한 현금 인출이나 Venmo와 같은 유사 P2P 결제 방식에서 사용할 수 없습니다.

하지만 대부분의 사람들에게 현금 결제는 가장 좋은 대면 결제 방식입니다. 기프트 카드를 사용할 경우 할인을 받을 수 있다는 점에서 유용하게 쓰일 수 있습니다. 선불 카드는 현금 결제를 받지 않는 곳에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 기프트 카드와 선불 카드는 온라인에서 현금보다 더 쉽게 사용할 수 있고, 현금보다 암호화폐로 구매하기가 더 쉽습니다.

### 오픈 마켓

[암호화폐](../cryptocurrency.md)를 소지하고 있을 경우 오픈 마켓에서 기프트 카드를 구매할 수 있습니다. Some of these services offer ID verification options for higher limits, but they also allow accounts with just an email address. Basic limits start at $5,000-10,000 a day for basic accounts, and significantly higher limits for ID verified accounts (if offered).

When buying gift cards online, there is usually a slight discount. Prepaid cards are usually sold online at face value or with a fee. If you buy prepaid cards and gift cards with cryptocurrencies, you should strongly prefer to pay with Monero which provides strong privacy, more on this below. Paying for a gift card with a traceable payment method negates the benefits a gift card can provide when purchased with cash or Monero.

## Virtual Cards

Another way to protect your information from merchants online is to use virtual, single-use cards which mask your actual banking or billing information. This is primarily useful for protecting you from merchant data breaches, less sophisticated tracking or purchase correlation by marketing agencies, and online data theft. They do **not** assist you in making a purchase completely anonymously, nor do they hide any information from the banking institution themselves. Regular financial institutions which offer virtual cards are subject to "Know Your Customer" (KYC) laws, meaning they may require your ID or other identifying information.

These tend to be good options for recurring/subscription payments online, while prepaid gift cards are preferred for one-time transactions.

## 암호화폐

Cryptocurrencies are a digital form of currency designed to work without central authorities such as a government or bank. While *some* cryptocurrency projects can allow you to make private transactions online, many use a public blockchain which does not provide any transaction privacy. Cryptocurrencies also tend to be very volatile assets, meaning their value can change rapidly and significantly at any time. As such, we generally don't recommend using cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value. If you decide to use cryptocurrency online, make sure you have a full understanding of its privacy aspects beforehand, and only invest amounts which would not be disastrous to lose.

!!! danger "위험"

    The vast majority of cryptocurrencies operate on a **public** blockchain, meaning that every transaction is public knowledge. This includes even most well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transactions with these cryptocurrencies should not be considered private and will not protect your anonymity.
    
    Additionally, many if not most cryptocurrencies are scams. Make transactions carefully with only projects you trust.

### 프라이버시 코인

There are a number of cryptocurrency projects which purport to provide privacy by making transactions anonymous. We recommend using one which provides transaction anonymity **by default** to avoid operational errors.

- [Recommended Cryptocurrency :material-arrow-right-drop-circle:](../cryptocurrency.md#coins)

Privacy coins have been subject to increasing scrutiny by government agencies. In 2020, [the IRS published a $625,000 bounty](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/?sh=2e9808a085cc) for tools which can break Bitcoin Lightning Network and/or Monero's transaction privacy. They ultimately [paid two companies](https://sam.gov/opp/5ab94eae1a8d422e88945b64181c6018/view) (Chainalysis and Integra Fec) a combined $1.25 million for tools which purport to do so (it is unknown which cryptocurrency network these tools target). Due to the secrecy surrounding tools like these, ==none of these methods of tracing cryptocurrencies have been independently confirmed.== However, it is quite likely that tools which assist targeted investigations into private coin transactions exist, and that privacy coins only succeed in thwarting mass surveillance.

### Other Coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)

The vast majority of cryptocurrency projects use a public blockchain, meaning that all transactions are both easily traceable and permanent. As such, we strongly discourage the use of most cryptocurrency for privacy-related reasons.

Anonymous transactions on a public blockchain are *theoretically* possible, and the Bitcoin wiki [gives one example of a "completely anonymous" transaction](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Example_-_A_perfectly_private_donation). However, doing so requires a complicated setup involving Tor and "solo-mining" a block to generate completely independent cryptocurrency, a practice which has not been practical for nearly any enthusiast for many years.

==Your best option is to avoid these cryptocurrencies entirely and stick with one which provides privacy by default.== Attempting to use other cryptocurrency is outside the scope of this site and strongly discouraged.

### Wallet Custody

With cryptocurrency there are two forms of wallets: custodial wallets and noncustodial wallets. Custodial wallets are operated by centralized companies/exchanges, where the private key for your wallet is held by that company, and you can access them anywhere typically with a regular username and password. Noncustodial wallets are wallets where you control and manage the private keys to access it. Assuming you keep your wallet's private keys secured and backed up, noncustodial wallets provide greater security and censorship-resistance over custodial wallets, because your cryptocurrency can't be stolen or frozen by a company with custody over your private keys. Key custody is especially important when it comes to privacy coins: Custodial wallets grant the operating company the ability to view your transactions, negating the privacy benefits of those cryptocurrencies.

### Acquisition

Acquiring [cryptocurrencies](../cryptocurrency.md) like Monero privately can be difficult. P2P marketplaces like [LocalMonero](https://localmonero.co/), a platform which facilitates trades between people, are one option that can be used. If using an exchange which requires KYC is an acceptable risk for you as long as subsequent transactions can't be traced, a much easier option is to purchase Monero on an exchange like [Kraken](https://kraken.com/), or purchase Bitcoin/Litecoin from a KYC exchange which can then be swapped for Monero. Then, you can withdraw the purchased Monero to your own noncustodial wallet to use privately from that point forward.

If you go this route, make sure to purchase Monero at different times and in different amounts than where you will spend it. If you purchase $5000 of Monero at an exchange and make a $5000 purchase in Monero an hour later, those actions could potentially be correlated by an outside observer regardless of which path the Monero took. Staggering purchases and purchasing larger amounts of Monero in advance to later spend on multiple smaller transactions can avoid this pitfall.

## Additional Considerations

When you're making a payment in-person with cash, make sure to keep your in-person privacy in mind. Security cameras are ubiquitous. Consider wearing non-distinct clothing and a face mask (such as a surgical mask or N95). Don’t sign up for rewards programs or provide any other information about yourself.

When purchasing online, ideally you should do so over [Tor](tor-overview.md). However, many merchants don’t allow purchases with Tor. You can consider using a [recommended VPN](../vpn.md) (paid for with cash, gift card, or Monero), or making the purchase from a coffee shop or library with free Wi-Fi. If you are ordering a physical item that needs to be delivered, you will need to provide a delivery address. You should consider using a PO box, private mailbox, or work address.
